---

  

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

  

* **Objective:** To effectively detect, identify, analyze, and document simulated adversary (Red Team) activities within the exercise network environment.

* **Primary Goal:** Maximize visibility into Red Team Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) without actively interfering, blocking, or remediating their actions.

* **Secondary Goal:** Assess the effectiveness of current monitoring tools, security controls (in detection mode), log sources, and analytical procedures. Identify gaps in visibility and detection capabilities.

* **Scope:** This playbook applies only to actions taken within the defined exercise network segments and timeframe, as outlined by the Exercise Control (White Team).

* **Key Principle:** **OBSERVE, ORIENT, DECIDE (on analysis path), ACT (by documenting/reporting), BUT DO NOT INTERVENE.** We are intelligence gatherers in this scenario.

## 3. Playbook Phases & Steps

  

### Phase 1: Pre-Exercise Preparation (Before "Go Live")

  

1.  **Understand the Environment:**

    * Review network diagrams, asset inventories, and data flow diagrams for the exercise environment.

    * Identify critical assets and likely Red Team targets (as perceived by Blue Team).

2.  **Review Rules of Engagement (ROE):**

    * Thoroughly understand the exercise boundaries, permitted actions (for Blue Team), prohibited actions (e.g., NO blocking, NO modifying Red Team tools/implants), and communication protocols with the White Team.

3.  **Verify Tooling & Access:**

    * Confirm access to all monitoring platforms (SIEM, EDR, NDR, Firewall Logs, Proxy Logs, Authentication Logs, Cloud Logs, etc.).

    * Verify tools are operational, agents are checking in (if applicable), and logs are flowing correctly into the SIEM or log aggregators. *Report any issues to White Team immediately.*

4.  **Establish Baselines:**

    * Review dashboards and logs to understand "normal" activity patterns within the exercise environment *before* the Red Team becomes active. Note common processes, network traffic, login behaviors.

5.  **Review Potential Threat Intelligence:**

    * If provided by the White Team, review intel on likely Red Team TTPs (e.g., specific malware families, C2 frameworks, exploitation techniques). Prepare hypotheses.

6.  **Set Up Communication Channels:**

    * Establish primary and backup communication methods for the Blue Team (e.g., dedicated chat channel, conference call).

    * Confirm White Team communication protocols.

7.  **Prepare Documentation Template:**

    * Set up a shared document, spreadsheet, or dedicated exercise logging tool to record findings consistently (Timestamp, Source IP/Host, Destination IP/Host, User, Process, Activity Description, Suspected TTP (MITRE ATT&CK Mapping), Analyst Notes, Confidence Level).

  

### Phase 2: Active Monitoring & Detection (During Exercise)

  

1.  **Continuous Monitoring:**

    * Actively monitor SIEM dashboards, EDR alerts, network traffic monitors, and other relevant tool consoles.

    * Watch for deviations from established baselines.

2.  **Alert Triage:**

    * Investigate *all* alerts generated by security tools.

    * Determine if an alert is:

        * A False Positive (Document why).

        * Benign/Expected Activity (Document why).

        * Potentially related to Red Team activity (Requires further investigation).

    * Prioritize alerts based on potential severity and relevance to expected Red Team goals (e.g., credential access, lateral movement).

3.  **Hypothesis-Driven Hunting:**

    * Don't just rely on alerts. Proactively search for specific TTPs based on intel or observed anomalies. Examples:

        * Unusual PowerShell or `cmd.exe` usage.

        * Connections to known C2 infrastructure categories or unusual ports/protocols.

        * Signs of credential dumping (LSASS access, specific tool hashes).

        * Anomalous login patterns (impossible travel, unusual source hosts, failed logins followed by success).

        * Creation of suspicious scheduled tasks or services.

        * Large data egress or staging.

        * Use of "Living Off The Land" Binaries (LOLBins).

4.  **Log Review:**

    * Periodically review key log sources even without specific alerts (e.g., VPN logs, authentication logs, proxy logs).

  

### Phase 3: Analysis & Identification (Upon Detecting Suspicious Activity)

  

1.  **Gather Context:**

    * Collect surrounding data for any suspicious event:

        * Precise timestamps.

        * Source and destination IP addresses/hostnames.

        * User accounts involved (source and target).

        * Processes involved (parent/child relationships).

        * Command-line arguments executed.

        * Associated network connections.

        * Related file modifications or creations.

        * Correlate data across different tools (e.g., EDR alert + Firewall log + Authentication log).

2.  **Identify TTPs:**

    * Map the observed activity to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework (or other relevant framework). What specific technique(s) is the Red Team likely using? (e.g., T1059.001 PowerShell, T1003 OS Credential Dumping, T1021 Remote Services).

3.  **Track the Activity Chain:**

    * Attempt to link discrete events into a logical sequence of Red Team actions. Where did they come from? What did they do first? Where did they move next? What was their objective?

    * Visualize the attack path if possible.

4.  **Maintain Situational Awareness:**

    * Share findings promptly within the Blue Team using established communication channels. Update the central log.

5.  **Crucial Reminder:** **DO NOT take any action to block, contain, isolate, or remediate the identified activity.** Your role is to observe and understand. If you suspect an action might interfere (e.g., running a deep EDR scan that could alert the Red Team), consult the Blue Team Lead/White Team first.

  

### Phase 4: Documentation & Reporting (Ongoing)

  

1.  **Log Findings Consistently:**

    * Use the prepared template to document every significant observation, including:

        * Timestamp (UTC).

        * Detection Source (e.g., SIEM Alert Name, EDR Detection, Manual Hunt Query).

        * Key Indicators (IPs, Hashes, Domains, Usernames, Hostnames, Commands).

        * Detailed description of the activity.

        * Mapped MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.

        * Analyst performing the analysis.

        * Confidence level (Low, Medium, High) that it's Red Team activity.

        * Screenshots or log snippets as evidence (if feasible).

2.  **Maintain Timeline:**

    * Keep a running chronological timeline of detected Red Team activities in the shared log.

3.  **Internal Updates:**

    * Hold brief internal sync-ups (frequency determined by exercise tempo) to share findings and coordinate analysis efforts.

4.  **External Reporting (To White Team):**

    * Report significant findings to the White Team POC according to the agreed-upon schedule and format (e.g., hourly email summary, immediate notification for specific "flag captures," end-of-day report). Follow the ROE strictly.

  

### Phase 5: Post-Exercise Activities

  

1.  **Compile Final Report:**

    * Consolidate all documented findings, timelines, and analysis into a comprehensive Blue Team report.

    * Highlight key detected events and TTPs.

    * Note any activities suspected but not fully confirmed.

2.  **Identify Detection Gaps:**

    * Based on the exercise debrief (where Red Team reveals their actions), compare what the Blue Team detected versus what actually occurred.

    * Identify specific Red Team actions that were missed. Analyze *why* they were missed (e.g., lack of logging, no detection rule, tool misconfiguration, analyst oversight).

3.  **Lessons Learned & Recommendations:**

    * Document key takeaways from the exercise.

    * Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improving detection capabilities:

        * New log sources to ingest.

        * New SIEM detection rules to create/tune.

        * EDR policy adjustments.

        * Need for additional tools (or better use of existing ones).

        * Process improvements for triage and analysis.

        * Training needs for the Blue Team.

4.  **Participate in Debrief:**

    * Actively participate in the formal exercise debrief session with the Red Team and White Team. Present findings clearly and be prepared to discuss detection successes and failures.

## Important Considerations

  

* **Exercise Mindset:** Remember the goal is learning and assessment, not "winning." Focus on maximizing detection and understanding.

* **Adherence to ROE:** Strictly follow the rules. Do not perform actions outside the agreed scope or prohibited actions. When in doubt, ask the White Team.

* **Safety:** While not blocking, if you observe Red Team activity that appears genuinely destructive or is moving outside the agreed-upon exercise scope, report it IMMEDIATELY to the White Team.
